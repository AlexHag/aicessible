}
Given the input of the user I want you to identify the action as one of these options: "MPay", "Remittance" or "Calling".
If none of these options can be identified from the input of the user I want set the action to "Unknown" and set the "response" property to something concise that will explain to the user that you were unable to identify what the user would like to do.
If it is unclear which transaction type the user want to perform, whether its an MPay transaction or a remittance transaction,
I want you to set the action to "Transaction" and then set the "response" property to something that explains to the user that they can either send a transaction with MPay or with Remittance and then ask them which type of transaction they would like to make.
